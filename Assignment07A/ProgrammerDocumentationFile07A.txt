Comments:
 This assignment gave a nice, straight forward, direction on how enums work. I 
 took a couple of minutes to find average times for traffic signal cycles. I 
 decided to pick values for seconds on averages I read on and from personal 
 experience. Declaring each enum constant with a constructor all in the same file 
 threw me off for a little but did not take too long to understand the logic.
