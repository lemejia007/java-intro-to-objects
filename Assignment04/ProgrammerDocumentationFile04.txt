Comments:
 I did not find method isPerfect() to be too difficult to declare as stack 
 overflow was very helpful in explaining possible ways to implement similar 
 methods that look for perfect numbers. Validation for this assignment was 
 similar to the validation I carried out for Assignment03 so validation was 
 mostly straight forward. I did however have slight difficulty thinking of a way 
 to make use of method isPerfect's return to display all perfect numbers from 
 MIN and maxInteger. After some thinking it was obvious that a loop is perfect.
