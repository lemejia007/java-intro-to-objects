Comments:
 This assignment was pretty straight forward. Although straight forward, in 
 order to implement user input validations, I found myself having to 
 spend some time reading more on the Scanner class and its methods. Something 
 I was glad to do as I became that much more familiar with class class Scanner. 
 Although not specified, I also went ahead and used function declarations, loops, 
 and an Array.
