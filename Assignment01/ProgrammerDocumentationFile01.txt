Comments:
 I had planned to complete assignment 01 by the early bird deadline but I had a 
 couple of distractions come up. I liked this assignment in that I felt that it
 helped transition from C++ to Java(helped break into Java). I also liked how it 
 made me learn how to format properly using the standard output object method 
 printf. Although not specified, I also went ahead and made use of the GUI/ 
 JOptionPane class to collect input from the user.
