Comments:
 This assignment was pretty straight forward. Although straight forward, in I 
 order to implement user input validations, I still found myself having to 
 spend some time reading more about the Scanner class and its methods. Something 
 I am glad to do as I became that much more familiar with the Scanner class. 
 Although not specified, I also went ahead and used function declarations and loops.
