 Luckily, I had already dabbled with class BigDecimal before in Assignment03 so 
 for this assignment, it was not too difficult converting the balance instance 
 variable from a double to a BigDecimal and proceeding to do all calculations 
 and operations as a BigDecimal. I did however have to touch up slightly on 
 BigDecimal's negate() and compareTo() methods. Surprisingly, I had to initialize 
 balance to BigDecimal.ZERO for a new Account object to have a balance of at least 
 0.00 instead of null when and if the constructor is passed negative values for 
 balance.
