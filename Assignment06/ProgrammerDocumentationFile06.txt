Comments:
 I liked this assignment. It was a good introductory to working with classes in  
 Java. Besides taking the time to try and write readable code, I spent more time 
 than expected validating. It took some time to get the buffer to read the 
 intended values. Overall a straight forward and simple program to implement on 
 its own minus the validation.
