Comments:
 	I decided to give myself a couple of days to complete this project. I knew 
 that if I began the day of or even the day before, I would have burnt myself 
 out. Giving myself time to complete the assignment allowed me start with a fresh 
 set of eyes the next day. The hardest part of completing this text adventure 
 game was actually starting! I was not sure where to start so I felt a little 
 overwhelmed at first. I then decided to break the project down. I started with 
 my interface, moving onto my parent class, then the two child classes, before 
 finally moving onto main. 
 	I had so many ideas and so many ways I could have possibly built the game, 
 that at times, I found myself stuck thinking, planning a new idea, and then 
 having to eliminate the idea because I probably was not going to have enough 
 time to actually implement it before the project due date. However, I 
 prioritized having a more simple but working product than an unfinished one. 
 Over all, I had a lot of fun with the project and coming up with endless ways 
 to implement it.
