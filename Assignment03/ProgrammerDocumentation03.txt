Comments:
 I actually had slightly more problems than expected doing this assignment. I 
 was under the impression that I could complete this assignment around an hour. 
 Although very possible with less validation and if doubles were used rather 
 than BigDecimal. I first ran into trouble figuring out how to properly validate 
 for an integer before validating for an integer between MIN and MAX (in this 
 case 1 and 45). After validating properly, I then had trouble properly processing 
 and out putting user input as BigDecimal. I guess I would have had less trouble 
 if I had previously worked with BigDecimals but I actually had to familiarize 
 myself on how it worked as I attempted to complete this assignment.
