Comments:
 I very much enjoyed this assignment. I began with only the theory knowledge 
 from the chapter reading but I gradually was able to piece it all together and 
 made it work. I think the hardest part was coming up with an interface or a 
 common functionality that two different classes could share. This assignment 
 gave me an "Ah-Ha" moment and definitely helped understand polymorphism that 
 that much better.
